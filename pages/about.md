## About Let's Get Free

Let’s Get Free: The Women and Trans Prisoner Defense Committee is a group working to end Death by Incarceration (also known as life without parole sentencing), build a pathway out of the prisons back to our communities through commutation reform, support successful possibilities for people formerly and currently incarcerated, and shift to a culture of transformative justice.

We prioritize working with women and trans prisoners, whose experiences are often left out in conversations about mass incarceration; we work to build relationships and community across prison walls; we are guided by  people in prison; we use art as an organizing tool; we educate to shift cultural understandings around harm, healing, and justice.

## About Creative Resistance

Let’s Get Free’s Creative Resistance Committee organizes art shows, creates films, and publishes original writing and poetry by people in prison. They also work on the public service announcements, social media graphics, magazines, newsletters and all things creative. Let’s Get Free has used art as an organizing tool since it’s inception, working to raise awareness about excessive sentencing while prioritizing the voices of women and trans people in prison.

This site only includes a subset of our creative imaginings!
