I have been incarcerated since 1977. I was arrested at the age of 19, and I am currently 46 years into a life without parole sentence, held hostage by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.","This acrylic on paper focuses on an aged Black man in prison blues squatting on the floor of a prison cell. The cell is dark and bare except for a small, barred window set high into the wall through which can be seen the black night sky and a portion of a full moon. The man’s head, shaved clean of any hair, sits atop a gracefully extended neck, the face turned up to the window, eyes closed. The man’s elbow rests on  the thigh of his bent leg and in his hand he holds an orange album cover decorated with “MILES DAVIS” in black and a black man in a purple suit playing a trumpet. The expression on the man’s face is one of recalling a fond and distant memory.",Acrylic,,,,Let's Get Free 2023 Art Show: Picture A Free World,,Image,image/jpeg,eng,,,image,"This acrylic painting depicts an aged Black man in prison blues, squatting on the floor of a prison cell, his face turned up towards the window, eyes closed, while he holds an orange album cover that says “MILES DAVIS”",
